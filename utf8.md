## Introduction

Unicode, short for Universal Coded Character Set, is a comprehensive standard for encoding and representing text in computer systems. UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit) is the most widely used encoding method for Unicode characters.

> **Note:** The term "Unicode" comes from "en-cod-ing" and is not related to programming. A more fitting name might have been "Unilang" (Unified Language).

## What is a Character?

Characters are the fundamental elements of written language and digital communication. They include:

1. Writing system characters (e.g., `1234`, `abcd`, `ìÅ®ìéÜìè§ìè§ìè§`)
2. Control characters (e.g., `\n` for newline, `\b` for backspace)
3. Signs and symbols (e.g., `‚úù` Latin cross, `Ô∏ª„Éá‚ïê‰∏Ä` ASCII art)
4. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) symbols
5. Emojis

## Character Encoding

Character encoding is the process of converting characters into a format that computers can store and process. Since the 1970s, a byte (8 bits) has been the smallest unit of data in computer hardware. Character encodings are software libraries that perform two main functions:

1. Encode: Write characters into bytes
2. Decode: Read bytes into characters

## UTF-8 Explained

UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding that can represent all Unicode characters. It uses between 1 and 4 bytes per character:

```
1 byte  : ASCII characters
2 bytes : Additional Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, etc.
3 bytes : Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.
4 bytes : Rare characters, emojis, etc.
```

This design allows UTF-8 to be backward compatible with ASCII while supporting the full range of Unicode characters.

## Glyph Rendering

A font (also called a typeface or font family) is responsible for displaying characters as visible glyphs. Some interesting features of fonts include:

- Alternate glyphs for the same character (common in handwriting fonts)
- Ligatures: Merging two or more characters into a single glyph
- Variable fonts: Capable of animations and dynamic adjustments

## Historical Context: Morse Code

Before digital encoding, Morse code was used to transmit text over telegraph lines. It's an interesting precursor to modern character encoding:

```
SOS in Morse code:
... --- ...

HELLO, WORLD! in Morse code:
.... . .-.. .-.. --- --..--   .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. -.-.--
```

## Unicode Updates

Unicode is regularly updated to include new characters and writing systems. The 2022 update (Unicode 15.0) included:

- New writing systems (Kawi script, Mundari language)
- Control characters for Egyptian hieroglyphs
- Additional astrological symbols
- Thousands of new CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters
- New emojis
